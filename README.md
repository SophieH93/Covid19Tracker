# Covid-19 Tracker

![](covidgif.gif)

This Covid tracker was created using Javascript, Google Maps and the Covid API is pulled from [Disease.sh](https://disease.sh/).

As part of [Profit with Javacript](https://www.cleverprogrammer.com/) we were thought how to create this tracker and I further challenged myself by adding the **'dark mode'** feature and the **'news feed'** using [RSS Feed generator](https://rss.app/).

## Future Features:
- Include the coverage for the Vaccine.
- Sort the Live cases from highest to lowest.
